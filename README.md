To compile and run the Fibonacci program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the Java files are located.

3. Compile the Java program using the following command:
   javac Fibonacci.java

4. Run the program with two arguments (maxInput and maxTime):
   java Fibonacci <maxInput> <maxTime>
   
   Example to run with maxInput 60 and maxTime 2000 milliseconds:
   java Fibonacci 60 2000
   
5. The output will display the Fibonacci index, result, and time taken by each method (recursive, dynamic, closed-form) for each Fibonacci number up to the given maxInput.
